# Go ERC20 Implementation

The [ERC20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) standard is a popular token standard in the Ethereum ecosystem.

For applications that use traditional software engineering, SQL databases are a common equivalent.

This repository implements the ERC20 standard using Go and Postgres.

The idea is that projects that kick off with traditional technologies like Go and SQL, using the codebase here will provide an easier time to migrate in the future to smart contracts if needed thanks to the matching interfaces.

Not production ready.
